This repo is a mere mirror of the AOSP changes pushed to
[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/refs/heads/androidx-main/car/app/app-samples](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/refs/heads/androidx-main/car/app/app-samples)

By using this repo, you don't need to clone the whole AndroidX repository.

This project would be redundant if Google would update their [car samples repo on GitHub](https://github.com/android/car-samples) more often.
